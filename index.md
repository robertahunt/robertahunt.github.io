## Coding Projects

### Pyautogui - Automate adding sound to flash cards - 2019
I got tired of manually entering all the sound clips into ankidroid, so I wrote a pyautogui script to do it for me. Non transferrable to another computer, but might be a good basis for someone else trying to do the same thing


### Building Flashcards from an Audiobook - Or how I learned to stop worrying and love Danish - 2019
I wanted to create some flashcards with audio in danish. Duolingo is great, but for danish the pronunciation is quite bad, memrise is better, as they have native speakers, but the flash cards there are quite boring and feel unnatural. Making flashcards from an audiobook (especially an from a book you like) is a lot more fun and engaging. 

### Unsupervised Clustering of images using Autoencoders - Masters Thesis
This is the code for my masters thesis on unsupervised clustering of images of butterflies in an attempt to find interesting clusterings and potentially determine if the one species is actually two based on visual features and clusterings. Results were largely inconclusive - The specimens could easily be seperated in an unsupervised way into two groups representing males and females, but no other obvious distinct clusterings were found.

### Butterfly Segmenter - Preprocessing for Masters Thesis
This process segments the images of the butterfly specimens from the Aarhus and Copenhagen collections and standardizes them through rotation, scaling, and color correction.

### Image Server - 2019
IIIF image server for hosting specimen images for the Natural History Museum of Denmark 

### Butterfly Blob Finder - 2018


### Digitization Station GUI - 2018

### TrAIval - Hackathon - 2018
